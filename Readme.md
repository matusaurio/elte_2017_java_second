The system accepts an input file to add guests to the party. The format for the file is:
* First line: Name.
* Second line: Specie name.
* Third line: Needs.
* Fourth line: Song.
* Fifth line: Arrival mode (flying, swimming, land).
* Sixth line

   Each arrival mode can have different attributes, in case of:
   * Flying: Extension of the animal wings.
   * Swimming: Where the animal comes from (sea or river).
   * Land: Number of paws

Repeat the process if there is more than one guest without leave any blank line after each guest (see the file input.txt).

Note: Only Mufasa can read and write files.
